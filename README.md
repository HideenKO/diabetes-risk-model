ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Project
This is my first Data Science project aimed at predicting whether a patient has diabetes based on medical data.
The goal was to apply basic data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning techniques to build a simple yet effective classification model.

Key features:

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Model training using scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)

Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC

Final model selection and interpretation of results
