ðŸ©º Diabetes Prediction Project
This is my first Data Science project focused on predicting diabetes based on medical data. I worked with two datasets: one from Kaggle and another custom dataset ðŸ§¾.

ðŸ”§ Whatâ€™s inside:

Data preprocessing & cleaning

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ðŸ“Š

Used a range of modern ML models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and others ðŸ¤–

Evaluation with key metrics: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC ðŸ“ˆ

ðŸ§  The goal was to gain practical experience in the full ML pipeline: from raw data to model interpretation.
